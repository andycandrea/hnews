# Haxx0r News - My Hacker News Clone

This is the repository for the clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) created as part of my internship at [Viget](viget.com). The app can be found live [here](http://haxx0r-news.herokuapp.com/) and will eventually come to include the features listed as enhancements under [Issues](https://github.com/andycandrea/hnews/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open).

If cloning this repo, make sure to run `cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml` and then edit the file to match your preferences and local environment.
